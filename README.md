# unapkm
There's a new split apk file format in town (apkm - https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/03/24/apkmirror-installer-for-android-now-in-public-beta-lets-you-install-app-bundles-and-apks/), but it's encrypted.

This is not helpful for modding or anything else really.

This tool decrypts them into a more standard APKS format that can be opened with 7zip.

```
Usage:
  java -jar unapkm.jar <path/to/apkm> <path/to/output>

```
